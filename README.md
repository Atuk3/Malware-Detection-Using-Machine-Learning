# Static Malware Analysis for Portable Executable Files using Machine Learning
This is my final year project and all the source code is in this repository


This project provides a Python-based tool for performing static malware analysis on portable executable (PE) files using machine learning techniques. The tool can extract features from PE files, such as header information, imported and exported functions, and opcode sequences, and train machine learning models to classify the files as malicious or benign. The tool can also perform various analyses on the features to gain insight into the behavior of the malware.

## Features
Extracts header information, imported and exported functions, and opcode sequences from PE files
Uses feature selection techniques to reduce the feature dimensionality
Trains machine learning models (such as decision trees, random forests, and SVMs) to classify the files as malicious or benign
Provides various metrics for evaluating the performance of the models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
Performs additional analyses on the features, such as clustering and visualization, to gain insight into the behavior of the malware
## Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
Open the main.py file and specify the paths to the directories containing the malicious and benign PE files.
Set the desired configuration parameters, such as the feature selection method, machine learning algorithm, and evaluation metrics.
Run the script: python main.py
## Results
The tool generates various output files, such as the trained machine learning models, the selected features, and the evaluation metrics. The tool also generates various plots and visualizations to help interpret the results. The results can be used to gain insight into the behavior of the malware and improve the detection and prevention of malware attacks.
