# Static Malware Analysis for Portable Executable Files using Machine Learning (NOT COMPLETED)
This is my final year project and all the source code is in this repository

## Project Vision: Machine Learning-Based Malware Identification and Classification

The project aims to develop a system that can accurately identify and classify malicious portable executable (PE) files using machine learning techniques. The system will analyze various features of the PE files, including file size, header information, and code sections, to distinguish between legitimate and malicious files.

The system will use a supervised learning approach to train a machine learning model on a large dataset of PE files. The dataset will be labeled with information about the malware family, allowing the model to learn patterns and characteristics that distinguish between different types of malware. The system will continually update its model to adapt to new malware variants and ensure accurate detection.

The main objective of the project is to provide a reliable and efficient solution for malware detection and classification. The system will be suitable for use by security professionals, researchers, and organizations to detect and prevent malware attacks.

The system will have the following key features:

Malware Identification: The system will accurately identify malicious PE files and distinguish them from legitimate files.

Malware Classification: The system will classify malware based on their family, providing insights into the behavior, tactics, and techniques used by different types of malware.

Machine Learning-Based: The system will use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to detect and classify malware, ensuring accurate and efficient detection.

User-Friendly Interface: The system will have a user-friendly interface, making it easy for security professionals, researchers, and organizations to use.

Overall, the project aims to develop a reliable, efficient, and accurate system for detecting and classifying malware using machine learning techniques. The system will help organizations and individuals better understand and mitigate the risks associated with malware attacks



## Features
Extracts header information, imported and exported functions, and opcode sequences from PE files
Uses feature selection techniques to reduce the feature dimensionality
Trains machine learning models (such as decision trees, random forests, and SVMs) to classify the files as malicious or benign
Provides various metrics for evaluating the performance of the models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
Performs additional analyses on the features, such as clustering and visualization, to gain insight into the behavior of the malware
## Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Atuke/Malware-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning.git
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
Open the main.py file and specify the paths to the directories containing the malicious and benign PE files.
Set the desired configuration parameters, such as the feature selection method, machine learning algorithm, and evaluation metrics.
Run the script: python main.py
## Results
The tool generates various output files, such as the trained machine learning models, the selected features, and the evaluation metrics. The tool also generates various plots and visualizations to help interpret the results. The results can be used to gain insight into the behavior of the malware and improve the detection and prevention of malware attacks.
