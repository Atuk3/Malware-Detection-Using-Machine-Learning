## ðŸ“š The datasets used:
The dataset used to train the first model is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/amauricio/pe-files-malwares)

The second dataset i.e Malware image dataset is the already generated dataset from microsoft's 2015 kaggle competition dataset, you can download it from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ep8qjakfwh1rzk4/malimg_dataset.zip?dl=0)

To get Malware samples to test the Model, you can download them from [here](https://github.com/Da2dalus/The-MALWARE-Repo)

So these are the datasets used for building two different models but in the end working as a pipeline. Now these datasets are somewhat old as they were published in 2017 and at the time of making this project they were relevant so you might want to change the data source or you can build a dataset yourself using some of the utility functions from the scripts of this project. Since there wasn't enough time to test this entire project on 1000s of PE files we didnt add the retraining of the data part but you can find that code in the scripts part and execute it when there will be enough new data available.
