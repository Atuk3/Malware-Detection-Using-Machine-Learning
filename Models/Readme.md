## Machine Learning models,
1. RandomForestClassifier : first model is trained on the portable executable files' different sections characteristic which allows us to classify whether a given input file is malicious file or not.
2. CNN model : This model is trained on 9639 malware images of 25 different malware families and using this model we try to classify the detected malware from the first model into 25 different malware families.
So starting with the first model, since we are working with the portable executable files we need to understand the structure of the PE files and which characteristics matter the most. Here is the link to understand the structure, if you want you can check it out [here](https://tech-zealots.com/malware-analysis/pe-portable-executable-structure-malware-analysis-part-2/)
